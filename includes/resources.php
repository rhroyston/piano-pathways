        <p>The studio follows a 16&#45;week fall semester &#40;August&#45;December&#41;&#44; a 16&#45;week spring semester &#40;January&#45;May&#41;&#44; and a 6&#45;week summer semester &#40;June&#45;July&#41;. <b>Students are required to enroll in all semesters</b>&#44; as the summer semester combined with a yearly registration fee will guarantee his lesson space in the studio for the upcoming school year. The studio complies with the EBRPSS school year calendar.
        </p>
        <p>Each student will have an exclusive weekly lesson time&#44; based on the most appropriate time determined by the teacher&#39;s&#44; parent&#39;s&#44; and child&#39;s schedule. Once the final lesson schedule is in place for the current semester&#44; lesson times&#44; days&#44; and length of time may not be moved or altered until the next semester. Lesson appointments can be changed at the beginning of each semester. A yearly registration fee during the summer semester will reserve each student&#39;s lesson time for the fall semester and is non&#45;refundable should the student decide not to re&#45;enroll after summer. Students interested in joining the student during the spring semester or summer semester will be offered available times in the teaching schedule and are required to pay a reduced yearly registration fee at the time of joining the studio.

                When you are placed with an instructor at Piano Pathways&#44; each teacher will put together her teaching schedule for the entire semester. Each family is asked to give 3 options for a lesson appointment&#44; and we do our best to place you a day and time that works for both the family and the teacher. Lessons can be scheduled during the week and also on weekends.<br>
                <br>
                The studio is open 7 days a week&#44; with teachers offering morning&#44; afternoon&#44; and evening appointments. New appointments are accepted based on teacher and family availability. Our most popular lesson times are on weekdays from 3&#58;00&#45;7&#58;00&#44; but we also can schedule home&#45;school families and adults at other times of the day that may be more convenient in their schedules.<br>
                <br>
                Though an afternoon or evening lesson may seem like the obvious choice for a lesson appointment&#44; our teacher Melanie offers before&#45;school lessons for students. A growing number of parents and children are discovering that well&#45;used morning hours yield benefits that afternoon hours cannot match. Here are a few reasons to consider scheduling morning piano lessons&#58;<br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                  <li>Getting kids up and out of bed. Sometimes it is more motivating to a child to have someone other than a parent expecting them at 6&#58;00 or 7&#58;00 a.m. to help them get out of bed. Knowing that he has an early music lesson can help a child feel motivated to get up and get moving. Less&#45;pressured morning hours can help create a healthy routine for your child.
                  </li>
                  <li>Greater focus and alertness. By afternoon&#44; a child has already been absorbing hours of educational and social detail that can distract his or her desire to attend to music study.  In the morning&#44; the child has the advantage of restful sleep as his most recent experience&#44; which will help him focus and absorb more of the lesson.
                  </li>
                  <li>Consistency. As much as we plan ahead&#44; afternoon lessons often have to be skipped for medical appointments&#44; family celebrations&#44; sports activities or other school events. Morning hours are more likely to remain dedicated to music study.
                  </li>
                  <li>Leads into morning practicing. Lessons in the morning are more likely to lead to a desire to practice music in the morning&#44; as the routine takes hold in the child&#39;s life.
                  </li>
                  <li>What a way to start the day&#33; A child who starts the day with the enlightening&#44; mind&#45;organizing&#44; heart&#45;focusing experience of music may feel daily values that settle his identity and sense of contribution to his world&#44; strengthening him for the other activities and interactions of his day.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                Both private and group classes are effective methods to learn to read music and play the piano. Here are a few differences&#58;
                <br>
                <br>
                The Group Class...<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Explores a variety of musical styles.</li>
                  <li>Can build confidence to play in front of others.</li>
                  <li>Builds positive peer support and motivation.</li>
                  <li>Teaches musical and non&#45;musical skills that are necessary to participate in a group.</li>
                  <li>“Practice” is replaced with the word &#34;play&#34; for at&#45;home time on the piano.</li>
                  <li>Is a longer lesson for a more economical cost.</li>
                </ul>
                The Private Lesson...<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is tailored to exactly the student&#39;s goals and rate of learning.</li>
                  <li>Is for a student who does best one&#45;on&#45;one with an adult.</li>
                  <li>Requires careful monitored practice&#44; and a weekly practice plan should be agreed upon with the parent at home.</li>
                  <li>Is for advancing students whose goals are to build piano technique and learn a variety of the classical repertoire.</li>

On weeks that schools are closed&#44; such as Thanksgiving and Christmas&#44; we do not have lessons those weeks. Learning to play the piano is a long&#45;term commitment&#44; so we hope that your child will be with us a long time. But we do understand that not everyone will take lessons through their entire schooling&#33; At the end of a semester is when your enrollment can conclude&#44; if you wish to withdraw from the program.

                No matter which lesson or class you choose for your child&#44; we strive to make every meeting a musical experience. Some of the musical skills that your child will learn in piano lessons are music reading skills&#44; performance skills&#44; aural skills&#44; practice techniques&#44; listening and evaluation of music&#44; music history and theory&#44; duet and ensemble playing&#44; and some composition and improvisation. Some non&#45;musical skills that your child will gain from piano study are confidence&#44; appreciation of different styles of music&#44; fine&#45;muscle coordination&#44; and concentrated focus&#45;time on an activity that does not give “instant gratification”&#33;

                We do ask that all Piano Pathways students enroll in some type of summer instruction. This is to ensure that your child won&#39;t forget everything that we have worked so hard to attain during the school year&#44; to maintain the business during the summer months&#44; and also to reserve your lesson place during the school year. Much can be learned during the summer months&#44; and there are lots of ways to be creative and flexible to accommodate summer lessons if you have a unique travel situation.
