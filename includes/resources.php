        <p>The studio follows a 16&#45;week fall semester &#40;August&#45;December&#41;&#44; a 16&#45;week spring semester &#40;January&#45;May&#41;&#44; and a 6&#45;week summer semester &#40;June&#45;July&#41;. <b>Students are required to enroll in all semesters</b>&#44; as the summer semester combined with a yearly registration fee will guarantee his lesson space in the studio for the upcoming school year. The studio complies with the EBRPSS school year calendar.
        </p>
        <p>Each student will have an exclusive weekly lesson time&#44; based on the most appropriate time determined by the teacher&#39;s&#44; parent&#39;s&#44; and child&#39;s schedule. Once the final lesson schedule is in place for the current semester&#44; lesson times&#44; days&#44; and length of time may not be moved or altered until the next semester. Lesson appointments can be changed at the beginning of each semester. A yearly registration fee during the summer semester will reserve each student&#39;s lesson time for the fall semester and is non&#45;refundable should the student decide not to re&#45;enroll after summer. Students interested in joining the student during the spring semester or summer semester will be offered available times in the teaching schedule and are required to pay a reduced yearly registration fee at the time of joining the studio.
